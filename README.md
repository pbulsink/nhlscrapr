#nhlscrapr

This is a reboot of the War-On-Ice nhlscrapr, including updates to make it work taken from elsewhere on the web, and some work to get it to pass package building by R's standards.

All credits go to the original authors.

Instructions for use can be found elsewhere online, including in older versions of this package [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nhlscrapr).
